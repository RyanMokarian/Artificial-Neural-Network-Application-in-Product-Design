Description:
    • The attached file is Chapter 4 from my Master Thesis at University of Saskatchewan. 
    • This chapter explains the development of a method to quantify one of the aesthetics attributes of design. 
    • For that prediction, an Artificial Neural Network was trained in MATLAB environment. 
    • It was published in Canadian Psychology CPA Annual Conventions in Halifax.
